# Enigma chat

This is a chat server and client that encrypts messages using the Scherbius Enigma cipher that was used by the Nazis during World War II.

To run the program startup the server using:
```
python enigma_server.py
```

And the client:
```
python enigma_client.py
```

Type in your username, the name of the person you want to talk to and the encryption key for the session.

The client and server have to preconfigured with the same IP address in order to work properly.

As an added bonus, here is a really cringe worthy video I made for the project two years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoeOCV9zMVI&feature=youtu.be
